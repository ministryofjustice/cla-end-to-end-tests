# cla-end-to-end-tests
This is the behave end to end tests which cover the CLA applications for the laa-cla-fala team.

## Current state of affairs
This currently works locally in a python venv:

`python3 -m venv env`

then

`source env/bin/activate`

Install packages from requirements.txt

You will need to install the chromedriver from here:

[chromedriver link](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

Once thats done you should just be able to run the tests using the command:

`behave`
